## Overview

### The challenge

Create a memory game in React where users try to identify which cards they have not previously clicked. Some features of this application will be, 

- Display card images from external API. 
- Use hooks to manage states while fetching data from API. 
- Display current user score and best score from session. 
- Cards should be displayed in a random order once one is clicked.
